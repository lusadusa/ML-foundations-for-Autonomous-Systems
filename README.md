# ML-foundations-for-Autonomous-Systems
This repository collects my work while transitioning from aerospace engineering (GNC/AOCS) into AI, Machine Learning, and Autonomous Systems.   It includes implementations of ML algorithms, neural networks, and reinforcement learning applied to dynamic systems.
